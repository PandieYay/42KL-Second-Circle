# 42KL-Second-Circle

Notes:
- minitalk was a fun project, learnt about signals and bitwise operators. Short but effective.
- so_long took so long, but was worth the wait. Teaches about mlx library which is a bit trash but good enough. No new functions but learnt a lot about 2D arrays.
- push_swap was the hardest project, but overall understood much more about algorithims after the project and recursion. Also no new functions but effective at pushing my brain.
